# Design Patterns and Guidelines

## Architectural Patterns

### 1. Adapter Pattern
- All documentation sources implement the `SourceAdapter` abstract class
- Provides consistent interface regardless of source type
- Enables easy addition of new sources without modifying core code
- Example: `FileSystemAdapter`, planned `ConfluenceAdapter`, `GitHubAdapter`

### 2. Singleton Pattern
- Used for service instances: `CacheService`, `MonitoringService`, `PerformanceMonitor`
- Ensures single instance across application lifecycle
- Accessed via getter functions: `getCacheService()`, `getMonitoringService()`

### 3. Factory Pattern
- `CircuitBreakerFactory` creates circuit breakers for different services
- `SourceAdapterRegistry` manages adapter creation and registration

### 4. Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Prevents cascade failures when external services are down
- Automatic fallback to degraded functionality
- Configurable failure thresholds and recovery times

### 5. Strategy Pattern
- Cache strategies: Different caching approaches based on content type
- Error handling strategies: Tool-specific error handlers in REST API

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Clear boundaries between layers (API, Core, Adapters, Utils)
- Each module has single responsibility
- Business logic separated from infrastructure concerns

### 2. Dependency Injection
- Services initialized once and injected where needed
- Enables testing with mock implementations
- Configuration passed as dependencies, not hardcoded

### 3. Error Handling Philosophy
- Custom error classes for different error types
- Never expose internal details in error messages
- Graceful degradation over hard failures
- Comprehensive error recovery guidance in API responses

### 4. Performance First
- Caching at multiple levels (Redis, memory, HTTP)
- Lazy loading and initialization
- Connection pooling for external resources
- Circuit breakers prevent resource exhaustion

### 5. Extensibility
- Abstract base classes define contracts
- New adapters can be added without core changes
- Plugin architecture for documentation sources
- Configuration-driven behavior

## Security Guidelines
- Environment variables for all credentials
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Sanitization of user inputs
- XSS protection in API responses
- No sensitive data in logs or errors
- Principle of least privilege for source access

## Monitoring & Observability
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Performance metrics for all operations
- Health checks for all external dependencies
- Real-time alerting for threshold breaches
- Comprehensive audit trail for operations

## Testing Philosophy
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for adapters
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths
- Mock external dependencies in tests
- Test data generation for realistic scenarios
