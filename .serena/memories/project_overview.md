# Personal Pipeline (PP) Project Overview

## Purpose
Personal Pipeline (PP) is an intelligent Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed for automated retrieval of internal documentation to support AI-driven monitoring alert response and incident management. It transforms scattered operational knowledge into structured, actionable intelligence for automated incident response.

## Current Status
- **Phase 1**: Complete (Milestones 1.1-1.3)
  - Foundation with 7 MCP tools and FileSystemAdapter
  - Development tools and testing utilities
  - Performance optimization with caching and monitoring
  - REST API implementation (Milestone 1.4)

## Key Features
- Sub-second runbook retrieval for critical operational scenarios
- Context-aware search with semantic matching capabilities
- Confidence-scored recommendations for automated decision making
- Multi-source integration supporting 10+ documentation systems
- Structured decision trees for progressive incident resolution
- Hybrid caching system (Redis + in-memory) with <200ms cached response times
- Real-time performance monitoring with comprehensive metrics
- Dual access patterns: MCP Protocol and REST API

## Performance Requirements
- Critical runbooks: < 150ms response time (achieved with caching)
- Standard procedures: < 200ms response time
- REST API endpoints: Sub-150ms for critical operations
- Concurrent queries: 50+ simultaneous operations
- Service availability: 99.9% uptime

## Success Metrics
- Sub-second response time for critical runbook retrieval
- 95%+ accuracy in matching alerts to relevant procedures
- Support for 10+ different documentation source types
- 40% reduction in MTTR for automated incident response
- 60-80% MTTR reduction with hybrid caching
