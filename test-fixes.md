# Fix Verification Summary

## Fixes Applied Locally

### 1. Docker Registry Permissions Fix ‚úÖ
**Problem**: `failed to push ghcr.io/personal-pipeline/mcp-server:0.3.5: denied: not_found: owner not found`

**Root Cause**: IMAGE_NAME was hardcoded as `personal-pipeline/mcp-server` in multiple workflow files instead of matching the repository owner `dpark2025`.

**Solution Applied**:
- Fixed IMAGE_NAME in `.github/workflows/build.yml` ‚úÖ
- Fixed IMAGE_NAME in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` ‚úÖ 
- Fixed IMAGE_NAME in `.github/workflows/enhanced-release.yml` ‚úÖ
- Fixed IMAGE_NAME in `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` ‚úÖ

**Expected Result**: Docker images will now push to `ghcr.io/dpark2025/personal-pipeline:*` which matches the repository owner.

### 2. Version Workflow Git Push Permissions Fix ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Version workflow fails at git push step with permission errors

**Root Cause**: Version workflow was missing explicit permissions, defaulting to read-only access.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added `permissions:` section to `.github/workflows/version.yml`:
  ```yaml
  permissions:
    contents: write  # Required for pushing commits and creating tags
    metadata: read   # Required for reading repository metadata
  ```

**Expected Result**: Version workflow will be able to push version bump commits and create git tags.

## Verification Status

‚úÖ **Multi-arch Docker manifest creation**: Already verified working (Issue #26 resolved)
‚úÖ **Registry permissions fix**: Applied locally, ready for testing
‚úÖ **Version workflow permissions**: Applied locally, ready for testing
‚è≥ **End-to-end pipeline**: Pending push of fixes to GitHub

## Test Plan

1. Push permission fixes to GitHub
2. Trigger Version Management workflow 
3. Verify version bump and git push succeeds
4. Verify Build & Package workflow triggers automatically
5. Verify Docker multi-arch manifest creates and pushes successfully
6. Confirm complete end-to-end pipeline functionality

## Expected Final State

üéØ **Complete working CI/CD pipeline**:
- Version Management: Creates version bumps and pushes to git ‚úÖ
- Build & Package: Builds multi-arch Docker images and npm packages ‚úÖ
- Docker Multi-Arch Manifest: Successfully creates and pushes to GHCR ‚úÖ
- Enhanced Release: Completes releases using build artifacts ‚úÖ
- All quality gates passing ‚úÖ

## Test Trigger

Version workflow test trigger - commit created to verify fixed workflow permissions.
