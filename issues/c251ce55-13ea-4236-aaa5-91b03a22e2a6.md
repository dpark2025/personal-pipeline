# Redis Connection Spam and Aggressive Retry Logic

## Title
Redis connection attempts are too frequent and create log spam

## Priority
Medium

## Severity
Medium

## Status
Open

## Description
The Redis cache implementation is aggressively attempting to reconnect to Redis server every 2 seconds, creating excessive log spam and potentially impacting performance. While the system correctly falls back to memory-only cache, the constant connection attempts are problematic.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Start the server without Redis running: `npm start`
2. Observe continuous Redis connection error logs every 2 seconds
3. Check health endpoint - shows Redis as unhealthy but system functional

## Expected Behavior
- Redis connection attempts should use exponential backoff
- Should limit connection retry frequency (e.g., max 1 attempt per 30 seconds)
- Should reduce log spam when Redis is known to be unavailable
- Should have circuit breaker logic to pause connection attempts after multiple failures

## Actual Behavior
- Redis connection attempted every 2 seconds continuously
- Logs filled with error messages: `"error": "connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379"`
- System generates alerts for cache being down repeatedly
- Performance may be impacted by excessive connection attempts

## Technical Details
- Error pattern: `connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379`
- Health endpoint shows: `"redis_cache":{"healthy":false,"connected":false,"response_time_ms":305}`
- System correctly falls back to memory-only mode
- Alerts being triggered: `Cache Service Down`, `Low Cache Hit Rate`

## Log Evidence
```
2025-07-29 15:45:42 [error]: Redis cache error {"error": "connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379"}
2025-07-29 15:45:42 [warn]: Redis cache connection closed
2025-07-29 15:45:44 [error]: Redis cache error {"error": "connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379"}
2025-07-29 15:45:44 [warn]: Redis cache connection closed
```

## Files Affected
- Cache service implementation (`src/utils/cache.ts`)
- Redis client configuration
- Circuit breaker logic
- Monitoring/alerting rules

## Impact
- Log pollution making debugging difficult
- Potential performance impact from excessive connection attempts
- Alert fatigue from repeated cache down alerts
- Resource waste from continuous failed connections

## Suggested Solution
1. Implement exponential backoff for Redis reconnection attempts
2. Add circuit breaker logic to pause attempts after repeated failures
3. Reduce log level for known connection failures
4. Configure Redis client with appropriate retry limits
5. Adjust monitoring rules to avoid alert spam for known issues

## Assign to
Backend Lead (Cindy) - Redis configuration and caching system expertise needed

## Additional Context
The system is working correctly in degraded mode, but the connection retry logic needs refinement for production use. This affects operational observability and could mask real issues.
