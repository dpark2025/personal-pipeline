# Missing /api/search HTTP Endpoint

## Title
/api/search REST API endpoint is not implemented but expected by demo scripts

## Priority
Medium

## Severity
Medium

## Description
The demo scripts and potentially other components expect a `/api/search` POST endpoint to exist for REST API access to search functionality, but this endpoint is not implemented. The server returns a 404 "Not Found" error when accessing this endpoint.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Start the server: `npm start`
2. Try to access the search API: `curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/search -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "test"}'`
3. Server returns 404 error

## Expected Behavior
- `/api/search` endpoint should exist and provide REST API access to search functionality
- Should accept POST requests with search parameters
- Should return search results in JSON format
- Should integrate with existing MCP search tools

## Actual Behavior
- Endpoint returns 404 with message: `{"error":"Not Found","message":"The requested endpoint does not exist","timestamp":"2025-07-29T22:51:38.632Z"}`
- Demo validation scripts attempt to use this endpoint and fail
- Server logs show 404 requests: `"POST /api/search HTTP/1.1" 404 110`

## Technical Details
- Expected endpoint: `POST /api/search`
- Should likely bridge to MCP tools like `search_runbooks` or `search_knowledge_base`
- Content-Type: `application/json`
- Response should be JSON format

## Evidence from Logs
```
2025-07-29 15:47:45 [http]: ::1 - - [29/Jul/2025:22:47:45 +0000] "POST /api/search HTTP/1.1" 404 110
```

## Files Affected
- `src/core/server.ts` (Express route definitions)
- Demo validation scripts that expect this endpoint
- Potentially documentation that references this API

## Impact
- Demo environment validation partially fails
- REST API functionality incomplete
- External integrations expecting REST API cannot function
- User experience inconsistent between MCP and REST interfaces

## Suggested Solution
1. **Add REST API Endpoint**: Implement `POST /api/search` in Express server
2. **Bridge to MCP Tools**: Connect REST endpoint to existing MCP search tools
3. **Input Validation**: Validate request parameters and format
4. **Response Format**: Standardize JSON response format
5. **Documentation**: Update API documentation to include REST endpoints
6. **Error Handling**: Proper error responses for invalid requests

## Assign to
Backend Lead (Cindy) - Express server routing and MCP integration expertise needed

## Additional Context
This appears to be a gap between the MCP protocol implementation and REST API expectations. The system has comprehensive MCP tools but lacks corresponding REST API endpoints for external integrations and demo purposes.
