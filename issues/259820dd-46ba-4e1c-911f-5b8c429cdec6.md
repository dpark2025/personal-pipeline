# Test Coverage Below Target Requirements - ✅ RESOLVED

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
**Resolution Date**: 2025-07-31  
**Resolved By**: Darren Fong (QA Engineer)  
**Resolution**: Comprehensive test coverage expansion achieving critical module targets

## Title
Test coverage is 14.13% but milestone 1.3 requires >80% coverage

## Priority
High (RESOLVED)

## Severity
High (RESOLVED)

## Description
The test suite coverage is significantly below the milestone 1.3 success criteria of >80% test coverage for core modules. Current coverage is only 14.13% for statements, with critical modules having 0% coverage.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run `npm run test:coverage`
2. Observe coverage report showing 14.13% statement coverage
3. See that core modules (server.ts, monitoring.ts, performance.ts) have 0% coverage

## Expected Behavior
- Statement coverage >80%
- Branch coverage >75% 
- Function coverage >80%
- Line coverage >80%
- Core modules should have comprehensive test coverage

## Actual Behavior
- Statement coverage: 14.13% (target: 80%)
- Branch coverage: 12.78% (target: 75%)
- Function coverage: 9.89% (target: 80%)
- Line coverage: 14.33% (target: 80%)
- Critical modules completely untested

## Coverage Details

File                 | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines
---------------------|---------|----------|---------|--------
All files            |   14.13 |    12.78 |    9.89 |   14.33

## Test Status
- 10 test suites failed
- 2 test suites passed
- 13 tests passed total
- Jest coverage thresholds not met

## Files Affected
- All core application modules lack adequate test coverage
- Test files exist but many are failing or incomplete
- Jest configuration has coverage thresholds that are failing

## Impact
- Milestone 1.3 success criteria not met
- Code quality and reliability uncertain
- Risk of production issues due to untested code
- Regression risk for future changes
- Professional credibility impacted

## Root Causes
1. **Test Implementation Issues**: Many test files created but not properly implemented
2. **ES Module Compatibility**: Some tests may be failing due to module system issues
3. **Test Infrastructure**: Testing framework may not be properly configured
4. **Incomplete Test Development**: Tests written but not completed or debugged
5. **Mock Configuration**: Insufficient mocking of external dependencies

## Suggested Solutions
1. **Fix Failing Tests**: Resolve the 10 failing test suites first
2. **Add Core Module Tests**: Write comprehensive tests for server.ts, monitoring.ts, performance.ts
3. **Integration Tests**: Ensure integration tests are working and comprehensive
4. **Mock Dependencies**: Properly mock Redis, external services, and file system
5. **Test Debugging**: Fix ES module and configuration issues preventing tests from running
6. **Coverage Reporting**: Ensure coverage is accurately measured and reported
