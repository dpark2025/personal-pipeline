# Test Coverage Below Target Requirements

## Title
Test coverage is 14.13% but milestone 1.3 requires >80% coverage

## Priority
High

## Severity
High

## Description
The test suite coverage is significantly below the milestone 1.3 success criteria of >80% test coverage for core modules. Current coverage is only 14.13% for statements, with critical modules having 0% coverage.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run `npm run test:coverage`
2. Observe coverage report showing 14.13% statement coverage
3. See that core modules (server.ts, monitoring.ts, performance.ts) have 0% coverage

## Expected Behavior
- Statement coverage >80%
- Branch coverage >75% 
- Function coverage >80%
- Line coverage >80%
- Core modules should have comprehensive test coverage

## Actual Behavior
- Statement coverage: 14.13% (target: 80%)
- Branch coverage: 12.78% (target: 75%)
- Function coverage: 9.89% (target: 80%)
- Line coverage: 14.33% (target: 80%)
- Critical modules completely untested

## Test Status
- 10 test suites failed
- 2 test suites passed
- 13 tests passed total
- Jest coverage thresholds not met

## Files Affected
- All core application modules lack adequate test coverage
- Test files exist but many are failing or incomplete
- Jest configuration has coverage thresholds that are failing

## Impact
- Milestone 1.3 success criteria not met
- Code quality and reliability uncertain
- Risk of production issues due to untested code
- Regression risk for future changes
- Professional credibility impacted

## Root Causes
1. **Test Implementation Issues**: Many test files created but not properly implemented
2. **ES Module Compatibility**: Some tests may be failing due to module system issues
3. **Test Infrastructure**: Testing framework may not be properly configured
4. **Incomplete Test Development**: Tests written but not completed or debugged
5. **Mock Configuration**: Insufficient mocking of external dependencies

## Suggested Solutions
1. **Fix Failing Tests**: Resolve the 10 failing test suites first
2. **Add Core Module Tests**: Write comprehensive tests for server.ts, monitoring.ts, performance.ts
3. **Integration Tests**: Ensure integration tests are working and comprehensive
4. **Mock Dependencies**: Properly mock Redis, external services, and file system
5. **Test Debugging**: Fix ES module and configuration issues preventing tests from running
6. **Coverage Reporting**: Ensure coverage is accurately measured and reported

QA Engineer (Darren) - Testing framework expertise and test implementation needed

## Additional Context
This is a critical blocker for milestone 1.3 completion. While the application functionality appears to work, the lack of test coverage creates significant risk and fails to meet professional development standards. Priority should be on fixing failing tests first, then adding coverage for critical modules.
