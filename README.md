# Personal Pipeline (PP)

> **üéâ Status**: Milestone 1.3 Complete - Performance optimization with caching, monitoring, and comprehensive demo environment! See [docs/DEMO-GUIDE.md](docs/DEMO-GUIDE.md) for the complete demo walkthrough.

An intelligent Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides automated retrieval of internal documentation to support AI-driven monitoring alert response and incident management.

## Overview

This MCP server transforms scattered operational knowledge into structured, actionable intelligence for automated incident response. It's specifically designed to support LangGraph agents handling monitoring alerts by providing context-aware retrieval of runbooks, decision trees, and operational procedures.

## Key Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Sub-second runbook retrieval** for critical operational scenarios
- **Context-aware search** with semantic matching capabilities
- **Confidence-scored recommendations** for automated decision making
- **Multi-source integration** supporting 10+ documentation systems
- **Structured decision trees** for progressive incident resolution
- **Escalation management** with business hours and on-call awareness

### Milestone 1.3: Performance & Monitoring
- **Hybrid Caching System** - Redis + in-memory caching with <200ms cached response times
- **Real-time Performance Monitoring** - Comprehensive metrics with percentile analysis  
- **Health Monitoring & Alerting** - System health checks with intelligent alerting
- **Circuit Breaker Protection** - Prevents cascade failures during service outages
- **Load Testing & Validation** - Stress testing with automated performance validation
- **Observability** - Rich metrics, structured logging, and monitoring dashboards

## Prerequisites

### Required Dependencies
- **Node.js** >= 18.0.0
- **npm** >= 8.0.0

### Optional Dependencies (Recommended for Production)
- **Redis** >= 6.0.0 - Persistent caching layer for enhanced performance
  - **Without Redis**: System works in memory-only mode with automatic fallback
  - **With Redis**: Provides persistent caching across restarts, improved performance, and better resource utilization
  - **Installation Guide**: See [Redis Setup Documentation](docs/REDIS-SETUP.md) for detailed installation instructions

### Performance Impact
| Mode | Cache Persistence | Startup Time | Memory Usage | Production Ready |
|------|------------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| Memory-Only | ‚ùå No | Fast | Higher | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Hybrid (Redis) | ‚úÖ Yes | Medium | Lower | ‚úÖ Recommended |

**Note**: The system automatically detects Redis availability and gracefully falls back to memory-only mode if Redis is unavailable. No configuration changes required.

## Quick Start

### Demo Environment (Recommended)
Experience all milestone 1.3 features with our comprehensive demo environment:

```bash
# One-command demo start with sample data, caching, and monitoring
npm run demo:start

# Interactive walkthrough of all features
npm run demo:walkthrough

# Validate performance targets and system health
npm run demo:validate

# Stop demo environment
npm run demo:stop
```

See [docs/DEMO-GUIDE.md](docs/DEMO-GUIDE.md) for the complete demo documentation.

### Production Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[username]/personal-pipeline.git
cd personal-pipeline

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure your documentation sources
cp config/config.sample.yaml config/config.yaml
# Edit config/config.yaml with your documentation sources

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start the MCP server
npm start

# Or run in development mode
npm run dev
```

## Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with pluggable adapters for different documentation sources:

```
LangGraph Agent ‚Üí MCP Protocol ‚Üí Core Engine ‚Üí Source Adapters
                                      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Wiki (Confluence, Notion)
                                      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
                                      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Web (REST APIs, Websites)
                                      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Files (Local, GitHub)
```

## Core MCP Tools

### Primary Tools
- `search_runbooks()` - Context-aware operational runbook retrieval
- `get_decision_tree()` - Retrieve decision logic for specific scenarios
- `get_procedure()` - Detailed execution steps for procedures
- `get_escalation_path()` - Determine appropriate escalation procedures

### Supporting Tools
- `list_sources()` - Manage documentation sources
- `search_knowledge_base()` - General documentation search
- `record_resolution_feedback()` - Capture outcomes for continuous improvement

## Performance Targets

- **Critical runbooks**: < 200ms response time (cached)
- **Standard procedures**: < 500ms response time
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime for operational scenarios
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ confidence score correlation with successful resolutions
- **Concurrent queries**: 50+ simultaneous operations

## Supported Documentation Sources

- **Wiki Systems**: Confluence, Notion
- **Version Control**: GitHub, GitLab repositories
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Web APIs**: REST endpoints, custom APIs
- **File Systems**: Local documentation, network shares

## Configuration

Create a `config/config.yaml` file to define your documentation sources:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: "ops-confluence"
    type: "confluence"
    base_url: "https://company.atlassian.net/wiki"
    auth:
      type: "bearer_token"
      token_env: "CONFLUENCE_TOKEN"
    refresh_interval: "1h"
    priority: 1
    
  - name: "runbook-repo"
    type: "github"
    repository: "company/ops-runbooks"
    path: "runbooks/"
    auth:
      type: "github_token"
