# Personal Pipeline

An intelligent Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides automated retrieval of internal documentation to support AI-driven monitoring alert response and incident management.

## Overview

This MCP server transforms scattered operational knowledge into structured, actionable intelligence for automated incident response. It's specifically designed to support LangGraph agents handling monitoring alerts by providing context-aware retrieval of runbooks, decision trees, and operational procedures.

The system provides dual access patterns (MCP + REST API), comprehensive documentation, and hybrid caching for improved performance.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üéØ Core Capabilities
- **üîç Intelligent runbook retrieval** for operational scenarios with <200ms response times
- **üß† Context-aware search** with semantic matching and confidence scoring
- **ü§ñ AI-optimized responses** for automated decision making and incident response  
- **üîÑ Dual access patterns** - MCP Protocol + REST API
- **üìä Structured decision trees** for progressive incident resolution
- **üö® Escalation management** with business hours and on-call awareness

### üöÄ Performance & Monitoring
- **üíé Hybrid Caching System** - Redis + memory with intelligent fallback
- **üìà Real-time Performance Monitoring** - Comprehensive metrics and health dashboards
- **üõ°Ô∏è Health Monitoring** - Automated health checks and status reporting
- **‚öôÔ∏è Circuit Breaker Protection** - Resilience patterns for reliability
- **üîç Observability** - Structured logging and performance tracking

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Features
- **üì¶ TypeScript/Node.js** - Modern, type-safe implementation
- **üìö Comprehensive Documentation** - VitePress website with multiple themes
- **üîÑ Automated CI/CD** - GitHub Actions with quality gates
- **üìã Semantic Versioning** - Automated release management

## Prerequisites

### Required Dependencies
- **Node.js** >= 20.0.0
- **npm** >= 8.0.0

### Optional Dependencies
- **Redis** >= 6.0.0 - Optional caching layer for enhanced performance
  - **Without Redis**: System works in memory-only mode with automatic fallback
  - **With Redis**: Provides persistent caching across restarts and improved performance
  - **Setup**: Set `REDIS_URL` environment variable to enable

### Performance Comparison
| Mode | Cache Persistence | Startup Time | Memory Usage |
|------|------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Memory-Only | ‚ùå No | Fast | Higher |
| Hybrid (Redis) | ‚úÖ Yes | Medium | Lower |

The system automatically detects Redis availability and gracefully falls back to memory-only mode if Redis is unavailable.

## Quick Start

  - name: "local-docs"
    type: "file"
    base_url: "./docs"
    recursive: true
    max_depth: 5
    supported_extensions:
