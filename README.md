## Overview

This MCP server transforms scattered operational knowledge into structured, actionable intelligence for automated incident response. It's specifically designed to support LangGraph agents handling monitoring alerts by providing context-aware retrieval of runbooks, decision trees, and operational procedures.

**Phase 1 delivered enterprise-grade infrastructure** with revolutionary dual access patterns (MCP + REST API), professional documentation platform, and production-ready distribution system.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔄 Automated CI/CD** - Complete pipeline with quality gates and security scanning
- **📋 Release Management** - Semantic versioning with automated changelog generation

## Prerequisites

### Required Dependencies
- **Node.js** >= 18.0.0
- **npm** >= 8.0.0

### Optional Dependencies (Recommended for Production)
- **Redis** >= 6.0.0 - Persistent caching layer for enhanced performance
  - **Without Redis**: System works in memory-only mode with automatic fallback
  - **With Redis**: Provides persistent caching across restarts, improved performance, and better resource utilization
  - **Installation Guide**: See [Redis Setup Documentation](docs/REDIS-SETUP.md) for detailed installation instructions

### Performance Impact
| Mode | Cache Persistence | Startup Time | Memory Usage | Production Ready |
|------|------------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| Memory-Only | ❌ No | Fast | Higher | ✅ Yes |
| Hybrid (Redis) | ✅ Yes | Medium | Lower | ✅ Recommended |

**Note**: The system automatically detects Redis availability and gracefully falls back to memory-only mode if Redis is unavailable. No configuration changes required.

```
LangGraph Agent → MCP Protocol → Core Engine → Source Adapters
                                      ├── Wiki (Confluence, Notion)
                                      ├── Database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
                                      ├── Web (REST APIs, Websites)
                                      └── Files (Local, GitHub)
```
