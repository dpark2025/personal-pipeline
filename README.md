# Personal Pipeline (PP)

> **ðŸŽ‰ Status**: Milestone 1.2 Complete - Enhanced with development tools and testing utilities! See [docs/MILESTONE-1.1.md](docs/MILESTONE-1.1.md) for Phase 1 details.

An intelligent Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides automated retrieval of internal documentation to support AI-driven monitoring alert response and incident management.

## Overview

This MCP server transforms scattered operational knowledge into structured, actionable intelligence for automated incident response. It's specifically designed to support LangGraph agents handling monitoring alerts by providing context-aware retrieval of runbooks, decision trees, and operational procedures.

## Key Features

- **Sub-second runbook retrieval** for critical operational scenarios
- **Context-aware search** with semantic matching capabilities
- **Confidence-scored recommendations** for automated decision making
- **Multi-source integration** supporting 10+ documentation systems
- **Structured decision trees** for progressive incident resolution
- **Escalation management** with business hours and on-call awareness

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[username]/personal-pipeline.git
cd personal-pipeline

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure your documentation sources
cp config/config.sample.yaml config/config.yaml
# Edit config/config.yaml with your documentation sources

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start the MCP server
npm start

# Or run in development mode
npm run dev
```

## Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with pluggable adapters for different documentation sources:

```
LangGraph Agent â†’ MCP Protocol â†’ Core Engine â†’ Source Adapters
                                      â”œâ”€â”€ Wiki (Confluence, Notion)
                                      â”œâ”€â”€ Database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
                                      â”œâ”€â”€ Web (REST APIs, Websites)
                                      â””â”€â”€ Files (Local, GitHub)
```

## Core MCP Tools

### Primary Tools
- `search_runbooks()` - Context-aware operational runbook retrieval
- `get_decision_tree()` - Retrieve decision logic for specific scenarios
- `get_procedure()` - Detailed execution steps for procedures
- `get_escalation_path()` - Determine appropriate escalation procedures

### Supporting Tools
- `list_sources()` - Manage documentation sources
- `search_knowledge_base()` - General documentation search
- `record_resolution_feedback()` - Capture outcomes for continuous improvement

## Performance Targets

- **Critical runbooks**: < 200ms response time (cached)
- **Standard procedures**: < 500ms response time
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime for operational scenarios
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ confidence score correlation with successful resolutions
- **Concurrent queries**: 50+ simultaneous operations

## Supported Documentation Sources

- **Wiki Systems**: Confluence, Notion
- **Version Control**: GitHub, GitLab repositories
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Web APIs**: REST endpoints, custom APIs
- **File Systems**: Local documentation, network shares

## Configuration

Create a `config/config.yaml` file to define your documentation sources:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: "ops-confluence"
    type: "confluence"
    base_url: "https://company.atlassian.net/wiki"
    auth:
      type: "bearer_token"
      token_env: "CONFLUENCE_TOKEN"
    refresh_interval: "1h"
    priority: 1
    
  - name: "runbook-repo"
    type: "github"
    repository: "company/ops-runbooks"
    path: "runbooks/"
    auth:
      type: "github_token"
      token_env: "GITHUB_TOKEN"
    refresh_interval: "15m"
    priority: 2
```

## Development

```bash
# Install development dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode with hot reload
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
