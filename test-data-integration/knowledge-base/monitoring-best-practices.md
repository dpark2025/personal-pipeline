# System Monitoring Best Practices

## Overview
Comprehensive guide to implementing effective system monitoring and alerting.

## Core Monitoring Principles

### 1. The Four Golden Signals
- **Latency**: Response time for requests
- **Traffic**: Demand being placed on the system
- **Errors**: Rate of failed requests
- **Saturation**: Resource utilization levels

### 2. Alert Design Philosophy
- **Actionable**: Every alert should require human action
- **Contextual**: Provide enough information for quick resolution
- **Proportional**: Alert severity should match business impact
- **Predictive**: Alert before problems become critical

## Implementation Guidelines

### Metric Collection
```yaml
# Prometheus configuration example
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

rule_files:
  - "first_rules.yml"
  - "second_rules.yml"

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
```

### Alerting Rules
```yaml
groups:
- name: example
  rules:
  - alert: HighErrorRate
    expr: rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]) > 0.1
    for: 10m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: High error rate detected
```

## Key Metrics to Monitor

### System Level
- CPU utilization and load average
- Memory usage and swap activity
- Disk I/O and space utilization
- Network throughput and error rates

### Application Level
- Request rate and response time
- Error rate and types
- Database query performance
- Cache hit rates

### Business Level
- User registration rates
- Transaction volumes
- Revenue metrics
- User engagement indicators

## Monitoring Stack Recommendations

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
- **AlertManager**: Alert routing and management

### Application Monitoring
- **APM Tools**: New Relic, DataDog, or Elastic APM
- **Custom Metrics**: Application-specific business metrics
- **Distributed Tracing**: Jaeger or Zipkin

### Log Management
- **ELK Stack**: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana
- **Structured Logging**: JSON format with correlation IDs
- **Log Retention**: Based on compliance and storage costs

## Dashboard Design

### Executive Dashboard
- High-level business metrics
- Overall system health
- Critical alert summary
- SLA compliance metrics

### Operational Dashboard
- Detailed system metrics
- Service-level indicators
- Alert status and trends
- Capacity planning metrics

### Developer Dashboard
- Application performance metrics
- Error rates and types
- Deployment success rates
- Code quality metrics

## Alert Fatigue Prevention

### Alert Tuning
- Regular review of alert thresholds
- Consolidation of related alerts
- Temporary alert suppression during maintenance
- Alert escalation policies

### Documentation
- Runbook links for each alert
- Clear remediation steps
- Historical context and trends
- Post-incident review integration

## Continuous Improvement

### Metrics Review Process
1. Monthly alert effectiveness review
2. Quarterly threshold adjustment
3. Annual monitoring strategy review
4. Post-incident monitoring improvements

### Automation Opportunities
- Self-healing systems for common issues
- Automated scaling based on metrics
- Intelligent alert routing
- Predictive anomaly detection
