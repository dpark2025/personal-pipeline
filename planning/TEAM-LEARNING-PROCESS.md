# Team Learning Process

## Post-Milestone Retrospective Protocol

After each major milestone completion, conduct agent retrospectives to capture institutional knowledge and improve team processes.

## Process

### 1. Identify Contributing Agents
- List all agents who worked on significant tasks during the milestone
- Focus on agents who handled complex problems or made key decisions

### 2. Conduct Agent Retrospectives
For each contributing agent, ask for reflection on:

**Query Template**:
```
I'd like to conduct a retrospective on your experience with [CONTEXT/MILESTONE].

Please provide a detailed reflection covering:

## Process Improvements
- What approach improvements would you recommend for similar issues?
- Any tools, techniques, or patterns that should be standard practice?
- How could initial analysis or requirements gathering be improved?

## What Worked Well
- What aspects of the problem-solving process worked well?
- Which decisions or approaches proved most effective?
- What made the implementation/solution successful?

## Areas for Improvement
- What challenges or obstacles did you encounter?
- Were there any missteps or inefficient approaches?
- What would you do differently next time?

Please be candid about both successes and areas for improvement. This will help capture institutional knowledge and improve our team's approach to similar issues.
```

### 3. Document Key Learnings
Add concise "Experiences" sections to agent files with:
- **Context**: Brief description of the work/milestone
- **Process Improvements**: Actionable recommendations for future similar work
- **What Worked Well**: Successful patterns to replicate
- **Areas for Improvement**: Specific enhancement opportunities

### 4. Keep It Generalized
- Focus on broadly applicable insights rather than specific technical details
- Emphasize process improvements and patterns over implementation specifics
- Ensure learnings can be applied to similar categories of problems

## Benefits

- **Knowledge Retention**: Critical insights captured for future reference
- **Process Improvement**: Continuous enhancement of team practices
- **Quality Standards**: Maintain high standards through learning from experience
- **Team Growth**: Institutional knowledge builds over time

## Schedule

Conduct after:
- Major milestone completions
- Complex problem resolutions involving multiple agents
- Significant architectural decisions or implementations
- Any time valuable lessons are learned that could benefit future work

## Example Entry Format

```markdown
## Experiences

### [General Category] ([Date])
**Context**: [Brief description of work/milestone]

**Process Improvements**:
- [Actionable recommendation 1]
- [Actionable recommendation 2]

**What Worked Well**:
- [Successful pattern 1]
- [Successful pattern 2]

**Areas for Improvement**:
- [Enhancement opportunity 1]
- [Enhancement opportunity 2]
```

This process ensures continuous learning and improvement while building valuable institutional knowledge for the team.
